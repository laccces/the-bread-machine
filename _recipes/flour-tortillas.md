title: Flour Tortillas
---

Makes 6

### Ingredients
- 240g plain/strong white bread flour
- Pinch of salt
- 3 tbsp (45ml) olive oil
- 120ml boiling water

### Method

**Step 1**  
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Once the dough is cool enough to touch, knead it into a smooth dough. Cover and rest for at least 30 minutes. Resting longer, up to an hour, makes the dough easier to roll out.

**Step 2**  
Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each ball out into a thin circle. Avoid over-flouring, just a light dusting when needed.

**Step 3**  
Heat a large pan over a high heat. Add one tortilla and cook for about 45 seconds, until bubbling all over. Flip and cook for a further 30 seconds on the other side.

**Step 4**  
Transfer the cooked tortilla to a plate and cover with a clean tea towel while you cook the remaining tortillas.

### Tips
- Rest the dough properly. At least 30 minutes, longer if you can.
- Don’t over-flour your work surface.
- Roll them thin and cook them hot.

## Sourdough Starter – From Day 1 to Forever

### Phase 1: Creation (Days 1–7)

#### Day 1
- In jar: 100g flour + 100g water  
- Stir until smooth and scrape down the sides  
- Cover loosely  
- Leave at 20–24°C for 24 hours

#### Days 2–5 (Once per day)
- Discard until 50g starter remains  
- Feed: add 100g flour + 100g water (1:2:2)  
- Stir, cover loosely, rest for 24 hours  
- Look for signs of life: bubbles and a pleasant sour smell

#### Days 6–7 (Twice per day, 12 hours apart)
- Discard until 50g starter remains  
- Feed: add 100g flour + 100g water each time  
- Starter should double in size within 4–8 hours and smell tangy

#### Ready when
- It doubles reliably between feeds  
- Texture is bubbly and sponge-like

### Phase 2: Low-Maintenance Weekly Routine

After week one, store the starter in the fridge with 50g remaining in the jar.

#### The night before baking
- Remove jar from fridge  
- Discard until 50g remains  
- Feed: add 150g flour + 150g water (1:3:3)  
- Leave at room temperature overnight until doubled

#### Bake day
- Use 100g starter for the dough  
- Return remaining starter to the fridge  
- No need to feed again until the next bake

#### If skipping a week
- Starter can last 2–3 weeks in the fridge unfed  
- If it has been over one week since the last feed, give two feeds before baking  
- Use a 1:3:3 ratio for both feeds, spaced 8–12 hours apart

## Lazy Sourdough Bread

### Ingredients (1 loaf)
- 100g active sourdough starter  
- 280g lukewarm water  
- 500g flour  
- 10–13g salt

---

### Day 1 – Evening
Feed the starter using the low-maintenance method  
Example: 50g starter + 150g flour + 150g water  
Leave at room temperature overnight until doubled and bubbly

---

### Day 2 – Morning
- In a large bowl, dissolve 100g active starter into 280g lukewarm water  
- Add 500g flour and 10–13g salt  
- Mix until a shaggy dough forms with no dry flour remaining  
- Cover and rest for 20–30 minutes (autolyse)  
- Return unused starter to the fridge for next week

---

### Stretch and Fold
- Every 20–30 minutes, stretch and fold the dough 4–5 times  
- Rotate the bowl each time  
- Repeat 3–4 sets over about 2 hours  
- Dough should become stronger and more elastic

---

### Bulk Fermentation (Afternoon / Evening)
- After the final fold, cover and leave at room temperature until doubled  
- This usually takes 6–10 hours depending on temperature  
- Dough should look puffy, wobble slightly when shaken, and may show bubbles

---

### Shaping (Evening)
- Lightly flour the counter and gently tip the dough out  
- Shape into a tight ball (boule) or oval (batard)  
- Place seam-side up into a well-floured proving basket or a bowl lined with a floured tea towel  
- Option: shape in the bowl first to firm it up, then tip onto wet parchment before transferring  
- Cover and refrigerate overnight for 8–24 hours

---

### Day 3 – Bake
- Preheat oven to 210°C fan with a Dutch oven inside for 20–30 minutes  
- Invert dough onto parchment and score with a sharp blade  
- Transfer dough (with parchment) into the hot Dutch oven and cover with lid  
- Bake for 30 minutes covered  
- Remove lid and bake for a further 20–25 minutes until deep golden brown  
- Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing

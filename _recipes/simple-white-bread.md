title: White Bread
---

### Ingredients
- 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 4g fast-action dried yeast
- 10g fine sea salt (sea salt flakes or table salt)
- 325g water, room temperature

### Method

**Step 1**  
Tip the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast. Pour over the water and mix with your hands or a spatula until a dough forms. Make sure all the flour is incorporated, including any around the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 minutes.

**Step 2**  
Sprinkle over the salt and work it in by stretching the dough over itself several times until fully incorporated. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Using the heel of one hand, stretch the dough while holding it with the other, then fold it back onto itself, turn 90 degrees and repeat. Continue for about 5 minutes, until the dough looks shinier and springs back when gently pressed.

Shape into a tight ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature for 1 hour, until doubled in size.  
For a deeper flavour, transfer to a clean bowl, cover and prove in the fridge overnight until doubled. Cold dough is easier to work with, so overnight is ideal.

**Step 3**  
Once doubled and light, tip the dough onto a work surface and knead a few times to knock out the air. Shape into a ball and rest for 5 minutes. Gently form into a tight, rounded shape, then place domed-side down into a proving basket or a bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Prove in a warm place for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or in the fridge for 2–3 hours, until roughly doubled.

**Step 4**  
Place a casserole dish with its lid in the oven and heat to 230C (210C fan, gas 8). When hot, remove the casserole. Flip the dough onto baking parchment, slash with a sharp knife, then carefully lower it into the casserole using the parchment. Cover with the lid and bake for 25 minutes.

Remove the lid and bake for a further 5–10 minutes until deeply golden with a crisp crust and hollow-sounding when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack for 40 minutes before slicing.

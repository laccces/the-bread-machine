### Method

**Step 1**  
Tip the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and oil into a large bowl. Pour over the warm water and mix with a spatula or your hand until it comes together into a shaggy dough. Make sure all the flour is incorporated. Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes.

**Step 2**  
Lightly oil your work surface and tip the dough onto it. Knead for at least 10 minutes until the dough becomes smooth, tight and springy. If using a stand mixer, knead with a dough hook for about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball and place in a clean, lightly oiled bowl. Cover and leave to prove for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

**Step 3**  
Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it into a long sausage shape. Cut in half, then divide each half into four pieces to make eight equal portions. Roll each piece into a tight ball and place on a floured baking tray, leaving space between each for rising. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until almost doubled in size.

**Step 4**  
Heat the oven to 230°C (210°C fan, gas 8). When ready to bake, dust each roll lightly with flour. Optional: glaze with milk or beaten egg and sprinkle with seeds. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until lightly browned and hollow-sounding when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.

---

### Ingredients

- 250 g strong white bread flour  
- 250 g rye flour

### Method

#### 1. Mix dry ingredients  
Combine the white flour, rye flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.

#### 2. Add wet ingredients  
Stir in the honey and olive oil. Add the water gradually, mixing until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough. Rye dough will feel heavier and less elastic than standard bread dough.

#### 3. Knead  
Knead for 8–10 minutes by hand or 5–6 minutes in a mixer. It will not become smooth and stretchy like white dough, which is normal.

#### 4. First prove  
Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave somewhere warm for about 1–1½ hours until roughly doubled in size.

#### 5. Shape and second prove  
Shape into a loaf and place on a lined tray or in a loaf tin. Cover and leave for 45–60 minutes until slightly risen and puffy.

#### 6. Bake  
Heat the oven to 220°C. Slash the top and bake for 30–35 minutes until deep brown and hollow sounding underneath.

#### 7. Cool completely  
Allow the loaf to cool fully before slicing. The texture sets as it cools.

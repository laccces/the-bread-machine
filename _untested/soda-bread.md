---

### Ingredients  
*Makes 1 loaf*

- 450g coarse wholemeal flour  
- 50g rolled oats  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 level tsp bicarbonate of soda  
- 1 tbsp treacle  
- 1 tbsp honey  
- 450ml buttermilk  
  *(or sour milk, or milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice)*  
- 1 tbsp melted butter, to finish

### Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F, gas mark 6) and grease a baking sheet.

Add all the dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk together to combine. Make a well in the centre.

Stir the treacle and honey into the buttermilk until fully mixed, then pour into the well. Working quickly, bring everything together with your hands until you have a soft, sticky dough.

Form the dough into a round on the baking sheet and cut a deep cross in the top.

Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the crust is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath.

Brush with melted butter and leave to cool slightly before tearing into it. Best eaten fresh, as it doesn’t keep well.

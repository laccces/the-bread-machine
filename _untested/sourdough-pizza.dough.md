title: Sourdough Discard Pizza Crust
---

**Yield**  
One 14" round or large rectangular thick-crust pizza,  
or two 12" round thin-crust pizzas

**Prep** 10 minutes  
**Bake** 16–18 minutes  
**Total time** ~5 hours (including rise)

---

### Ingredients
- 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, unfed (discard)
- 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp to 3/4 cup (141g–170g) lukewarm water
- 2 1/2 cups (300g) plain (all-purpose) flour
- 1 tsp table salt
- 1/2 tsp instant or active dry yeast
- 4 tsp pizza dough flavouring, optional

### Method

#### Make the dough
Stir any liquid back into your starter, then measure out 1 cup (227g) into a large bowl.

Add the lower amount of water, flour, salt, yeast and optional flavouring. Mix to combine, adding more water a tablespoon at a time if the dough looks dry.

Knead for about 7 minutes using a stand mixer with a dough hook, until the dough is smooth and cleans the sides of the bowl.

Place the dough in a lightly greased container, cover and leave to rise until almost doubled. This will take 2–4 hours depending on the strength of your starter. A warm spot will speed things up.

#### Shape the dough

**For two thin-crust pizzas**  
Divide the dough in half and shape into flattened disks. Oil two 12" pizza pans and place the dough into them. Cover and rest for 15 minutes, then gently press out to the edges. If the dough resists, rest for another 15 minutes before continuing.

**For one thick-crust pizza**  
Oil a 14" round pizza pan or an 18" x 13" baking tray. Place the dough in the pan and press out to the edges, resting for 15 minutes if it springs back.

Cover and let rise until the dough reaches your preferred thickness.

#### Bake
Towards the end of the rise, heat the oven to 230°C (450°F).

Sauce and top the pizza, but don’t add cheese yet.

- Thin crust: bake for 5 minutes, then remove, add cheese, and return to the oven for 5–7 minutes.
- Thick crust: bake for 10 minutes, then remove, add cheese, and return to the oven for 5–7 minutes.

Bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is crisp.

### Storage
Leftover pizza keeps well wrapped in the fridge for up to 5 days.
